# GeoPy aims at facilitating seismic data analysis in Python.
# <For PIP installation without conflicting with an existing geopy package, a new version has been created as [cognitivegeo](https://github.com/geopyteam/cognitivegeo) with more features including 3D visualization and so on.>

# To run it, simply
#     1. download and unzip the codes to be searchable by your python path
#     2. check dependecy.txt to ensure all required packages installed already, particularly PyQt5; otherwise, install them by pip install package-name
#     3. run by "python /your/geopy/path/main.py" or in your python IDE
# More information can be found at the [GeoPy](https://geopyinfo.wixsite.com/geopy) website.
